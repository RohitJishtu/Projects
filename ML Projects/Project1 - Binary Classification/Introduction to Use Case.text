Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset


Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series!
Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!

With the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in October every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 3 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

Your Goal: Predict defects in C programs given various various attributes about the code.
