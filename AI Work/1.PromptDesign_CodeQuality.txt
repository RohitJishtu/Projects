Code = 
nums = [3,2,4]
target = 6
output=[]
dict={}



# Dictionary stores all unmatches , matches gets printed in array
# {7:0, = Element and Dict[7]
#  2:1, <> All Dict Comparison
#  -2:2 <>
#  -4:3 <>

for i in range(0,len(nums)):
    if nums[i] in dict:
      output.append(i)
      output.append(dict[nums[i]])
      print('dict If',dict)
    else:
      dict[target-nums[i]]=i
      print('dict Else',dict)




print(output)
