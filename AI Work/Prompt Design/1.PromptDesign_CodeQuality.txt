Convert production schedule: write a function to convert compressed production schedule code to decompressed ones.
input: compressed = '3[A]2[3[B]]C'
output: 'AAABBBBBBC':

# Number comes and character after that , we print the character number times
# we store character : Number in dictionary , and run to print

# ischar()
# isnum()
# A:3
# B:3*2
# C:1


# 3 Comparison of special chars
# 10 numeric comparisons
