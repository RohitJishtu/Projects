About the job
Are you excited to work with AI in a strong professional environment?

At Storebrand, we truly believe in the potential of AI. Our commitment to leveraging advanced technology, machine learning and AI is key to creating innovative business solutions and enhancing customer experiences. We invite you to join our journey as a Machine Learning Engineer within the Center of Excellence for Data & AI.

The Center of Excellence for Data & AI is centrally and strategically positioned within Storebrand, dedicated to influencing and driving AI initiatives across Storebrand’s business areas. You will be part of a community of other data analysts, scientists and engineers in our unit, and collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and domain experts from the rest of the organization in cross-functional teams.

Your role will have you working with a range of cutting-edge technologies. We use Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure as our cloud service providers, and we deploy both Databricks and Snowflake for data processing, analytics and AI. We are also using dbt cloud as a transformation tool, Dagster for orchestration, MLflow for MLOps and model lifecycle management, GitHub for version control and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

What you will be doing:

We spent much of the past year understanding and exploring generative AI and its uses, and believe that scaling and streamlining our AI initiatives will be important going forward. In addition to developing and deploying AI and machine learning models, you will therefore be working on improving our data and AI platform to help us create more robust and impactful AI solutions. This means that you will, for example, simplify working with structured and unstructured data, creating analytics pipelines and applications, evaluating and improving existing solutions in production.

Some of the areas where AI plays a crucial role include preventing insurance fraud, optimizing internal processes, streamlining marketing and sales activities, enhancing our services and customer experiences, and enabling and increasing the efficiency of our workforce through AI-based tools and solutions.

Your work will primarily involve leveraging Generative AI within Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure environments, along with using Databricks and Snowflake for data processing and machine learning model building. You will actively contribute to our MLOps framework, ensuring the robust deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models from input data to end-user application. You will also be instrumental in exploring and integrating state-of-the-art technologies, such as Generative AI and advanced language models, to push the boundaries of what’s possible in our applications.

Who are you?

You are likely someone with a technical degree and a passion for machine learning and AI. We believe you are proficient in Python and/or other programming languages, as well as SQL. Hands-on experience with cloud-based environments, Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Docker, or dbt is beneficial, but not mandatory. Finally, we believe you are a problem-solver, comfortable working in collaborative settings, and eager to keep up with the latest trends in AI and machine learning.

At Storebrand, you will be part of a dynamic environment where innovation and forward-thinking are at the forefront. If you are passionate about using your machine learning expertise to drive real business impact and enjoy working in a collaborative, tech-forward environment, we encourage you to apply.

Why choose Storebrand?

At Storebrand we encourage our employees to take up space and voice their opinions. We facilitate personal development and learning through continuous competence development in the form of professional groups, conferences, training, and innovation days.

We believe in the value of having different perspectives and backgrounds in our organisation, and therefore work actively to create a social environment that is inclusive and diverse. We have been recognized for this work by, for example, the awarding of the SHE-index prize for 2023 and 2024, an equality index that measures and compares the gender balance in companies.

We are based in Lysaker, centrally located near public transport, and with ample capacity for bicycle parking and changing rooms. We are also concerned about your health and have good agreements with doctors, psychologists, as well as occupational health services. Our premises also house a chiropractor/physiotherapist and a wide range of training opportunities through well-equipped training rooms and our own gymnasium.

Furthermore, as an employee, you will enjoy a very good pension scheme, favourable insurances in addition to a subsidized employee loan for home purchase.

Questions about the team or the role? Contact Ørjan Dale (Head of Analytics & AI) on orjan.dale.2@storebrand.no or +47 92854865.

Application deadline: 12.01.2025.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Story={

I have always had a passion for data and playing with numbers since childhood. I excelled in basic stats, outpacing my peers in calculations, and even managed scoreboards during our play sessions back in the day.

In modern times, there is a significant emphasis on data as a valuable asset. We discuss coupling it with modern processing systems to solve problems. We've come a long way in analytics, transitioning from reporting on the past to precision in understanding and utilising historical data.

My love for programming has flourished in the latter part of my career, leading to improved problem-solving skills. I continuously adapt my approaches to problem-solving, recognising that learning is constant in the technological world where change is inevitable.

I am enthusiastic about reading and writing(amateur) and have been leading the Book Club in my current Org, It requires a lot of effort to write and I believe it’s our responsibility to keep the raw art of reading alive, let’s not let AI influence our judgement for now.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an ardent lover of books and reading. My fascination with numbers and data has led me to explore and self-teach extensively in Machine Learning. Early in my career, working closely with Data Scientists provided me with a unique context on how to approach problems strategically, emphasizing thoughtful analysis before diving into coding. My unique selling proposition lies in my vast industry experience with SQL and Spark, collaborating with diverse teams to understand data intricacies and solve complex problems, complementing my expertise in Data Science.

On a personal note, my family, consisting of two members, has had the pleasure of visiting Europe twice. We fell in love with the weather and the overall quality of life, making the prospect of working with Wolt even more exciting.
