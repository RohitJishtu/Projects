Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with the mission to be the most trusted driver. Since its start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, a fully autonomous ride-hailing service, and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over one million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving tens of millions of miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 13+ U.S. states.

The Simulator team builds state-of-the-art simulations of realistic environments for the testing and training of the Waymo driver. We use machine learning to model the real world, including realistic agents (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists etc.), roads, traffic control systems, and weather. To increase the fidelity and steerability of the simulations, we employ large foundation models, trained on our massive datasets that allow us to quickly setup and rollout multiple scenarios to subject our driver to.

We are planning to set up a team in London UK to work with the teams in MTV and Oxford to build these foundation models out and to integrate them into several evaluation and training products. We are looking for research engineers to work on these exciting problems.

In this hybrid role, you will report to an Engineering Director.

You will:

Be part of a world class research engineering team to grow the state-of-the-art of ultra realistic AV simulations using foundation models
Collaborate with teams in Waymo Oxford to use large models to improve sim realism
Design experiments that push the frontiers of AV simulations
Develop metrics that measure the realism of simulated worlds
Train and evaluate large models and integrate them into the simulator and its downstream applications
Help hire outstanding research engineers from diverse backgrounds
Be a part of a collaborative research engineering team that takes research ideas and productionizes them
We prefer:

5+ years experience in applied Deep Learning
5+ years coding and design skills
Experience solving complex production problems using state-of-the-art ML techniques
Experience taking research to production
Expertise in Data Analysis or Data Science
#LI-Hybrid

The expected base salary range for this full-time position is listed below. Actual starting pay will be based on job-related factors, including exact work location, experience, relevant training and education, and skill level.  Waymo employees are also eligible to participate in Waymo’s discretionary annual bonus program, equity incentive plan, and generous Company benefits program, subject to eligibility requirements.
Salary Range
£145,000—£157,000 GBP.}

Story={

I have always had a passion for data and playing with numbers since childhood. I excelled in basic stats, outpacing my peers in calculations, and even managed scoreboards during our play sessions back in the day.

In modern times, there is a significant emphasis on data as a valuable asset. We discuss coupling it with modern processing systems to solve problems. We've come a long way in analytics, transitioning from reporting on the past to precision in understanding and utilising historical data.

My love for programming has flourished in the latter part of my career, leading to improved problem-solving skills. I continuously adapt my approaches to problem-solving, recognising that learning is constant in the technological world where change is inevitable.

I am enthusiastic about reading and writing(amateur) and have been leading the Book Club in my current Org, It requires a lot of effort to write and I believe it’s our responsibility to keep the raw art of reading alive, let’s not let AI influence our judgement for now.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an ardent lover of books and reading. My fascination with numbers and data has led me to explore and self-teach extensively in Machine Learning. Early in my career, working closely with Data Scientists provided me with a unique context on how to approach problems strategically, emphasizing thoughtful analysis before diving into coding. My unique selling proposition lies in my vast industry experience with SQL and Spark, collaborating with diverse teams to understand data intricacies and solve complex problems, complementing my expertise in Data Science.

On a personal note, my family, consisting of two members, has had the pleasure of visiting Europe twice. We fell in love with the weather and the overall quality of life, making the prospect of working with Wolt even more exciting.
