Story={

My passion for data and numbers began in childhood, where I excelled in basic statistics and outpaced my peers in calculations. I even managed scoreboards during play sessions, sparking my early interest in data. Over time, this passion evolved into a career focused on AI and Machine Learning, where I specialise in building scalable ML and data pipeline systems for predictions, forming the backbone of modern Enterprise Analytics solutions.

In the last decade, we’ve seen a significant shift from classical ML models to more sophisticated AI systems (dare I say), and I’ve been at the forefront of this evolution. My recent focus has been on designing scalable, agentic AI systems that leverage infrastructure to solve problems more efficiently, speeding up responses and creating impactful solutions for my org.

As a lover of programming, I’ve continually honed my problem-solving skills, recognising how the programming landscape has evolved for the better. However, I strive to avoid getting caught up in fleeting AI trends and instead focus on deepening my understanding of the technology.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about reading and writing (amateur), and involved in a Book Club at my organisation. I believe it’s important to preserve the raw art of reading and not let AI influence our judgment on this timeless practice.
