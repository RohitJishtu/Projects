Story={

I have always had a passion for data and playing with numbers since childhood. I excelled in basic stats, outpacing my peers in calculations, and even managed scoreboards during our play sessions back in the day.

In modern times, there is a significant emphasis on data as a valuable asset. We discuss coupling it with modern processing systems to solve problems. We've come a long way in analytics, transitioning from reporting on the past to precision in understanding and utilising historical data.

My love for programming has flourished in the latter part of my career, leading to improved problem-solving skills. I continuously adapt my approaches to problem-solving, recognising that learning is constant in the technological world where change is inevitable.

I am enthusiastic about reading and writing(amateur) and have been leading the Book Club in my current Org, It requires a lot of effort to write and I believe it’s our responsibility to keep the raw art of reading alive, let’s not let AI influence our judgement for now.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an ardent lover of books and reading. My fascination with numbers and data has led me to explore and self-teach extensively in Machine Learning. Early in my career, working closely with Data Scientists provided me with a unique context on how to approach problems strategically, emphasizing thoughtful analysis before diving into coding. My unique selling proposition lies in my vast industry experience with SQL and Spark, collaborating with diverse teams to understand data intricacies and solve complex problems, complementing my expertise in Data Science.

On a personal note, my family, consisting of two members, has had the pleasure of visiting Europe twice. We fell in love with the weather and the overall quality of life, making the prospect of working with Wolt even more exciting.
