# Projects

Welcome to My Repository! This public codebase showcases solutions to coding challenges, machine learning projects, and practical tips for problem-solving.

With over 12 years of experience in IT, analytics, and machine learning, I‚Äôve been passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. My expertise lies in building scalable data pipelines and orchestrating end-to-end ML projects. Some highlights of my work include developing lead-scoring models and product recommendation systems that drive customer retention and optimize upselling.

In this rapidly evolving AI landscape, I‚Äôm particularly fascinated by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve real-world business challenges. Having come to programming later in my career, I thrive on continuous learning and creative problem-solving.

Beyond coding, I‚Äôm an avid reader, traveler, and philosopher at heart. I believe in a balance of technical rigor and creativity, and I hope to inspire others through my projects and ideas.

Let‚Äôs learn and innovate together!
