# Projects

Thanks for visiting !!

The repo is a public code base includes , coding problem solutions , Basic Projects and Problem solving.

With 12 years in the dynamic realm of IT and analytics, I joyfully unravel the complexities of mathematical concepts into actionable insights. Crafting robust data pipelines and orchestrating end-to-end ML projects have been the cornerstones of my privileged journey. Noteworthy achievements include pioneering lead scoring and refining product recommendation systems, with a keen focus on reducing churn and optimizing upselling.

In the era of AI dominance, my passion extends to using and tuning Language Model (LLM) solutions for business challenges. While coding fascinates me, I humbly acknowledge I'm far from being an expert. Beyond data, I'm driven by an eternal optimism and a creative problem-solving spirit, exploring realms of literature, travel, and philosophy during my leisure. 

Excited to infuse my expertise to all repo readers.
