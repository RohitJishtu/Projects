hashtag#Python hashtag#Basics for Data Engineers:
1Ô∏è‚É£ How is memory managed in Python? Explain the concept of reference counting and garbage collection.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are Python's built-in data structures, and when would you use each (e.g., list, tuple, set, dict)?
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects in Python. How does this affect how data is passed to functions?
 4Ô∏è‚É£ How would you handle large datasets that don‚Äôt fit into memory in Python?
 5Ô∏è‚É£ What are Python generators, and how do they help with memory efficiency? Provide an example.
 6Ô∏è‚É£ Explain how pandas.DataFrame differs from a regular Python dictionary or list for data manipulation.
 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python? Provide examples.
 8Ô∏è‚É£ Write a Python function to parse a CSV file and load it into a database.
 9Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle missing or null values in a dataset using Python?
 üîü Explain the use of itertools in Python for data processing. Provide examples of common use cases.

hashtag#Intermediate Data Engineering Tasks:
1Ô∏è‚É£ How would you use Python to automate the ingestion of data from multiple sources (e.g., APIs, flat files, databases)?
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Write a script to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from an S3 bucket to a Snowflake table.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain how to use boto3 for managing AWS services like S3 and DynamoDB in Python.
 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between batch processing and real-time data processing in Python? Which libraries would you use for each?
 5Ô∏è‚É£ Write a Python script to process a log file and extract error entries based on specific patterns.
 6Ô∏è‚É£ How would you optimize a pandas DataFrame for large-scale data processing?
 7Ô∏è‚É£ Explain how sqlalchemy can be used for interacting with databases in Python.
 8Ô∏è‚É£ How would you detect and handle schema drift in an incoming JSON file using Python?
 9Ô∏è‚É£ Write a Python program to monitor the performance of an ETL pipeline and log metrics.
 üîü How would you implement retry logic for a failed API call in Python?


Basic Level:
1. What is Apache Kafka, and what are its core components?
2. Explain the difference between a topic, partition, and segment.
3. How does Kafka ensure message ordering?
4. What is a consumer group in Kafka?

Intermediate Level:
5. How does Kafka achieve fault tolerance? 
6. Explain Kafka's partitioning strategy and how it impacts performance.
7. Describe Kafka's consumer offset management.

Advanced Level:
8. Explain the concept of exactly-once semantics (EOS) in Kafka.
9. How would you monitor and optimize Kafka performance in a production environment? 
10. How would you design a Kafka-based system to guarantee data consistency in the event of node failures?

Over the years, I've explored Kafka's powerful capabilities in various projects, and I know firsthand how crucial the right resources are when implementing it from scratch.
