1.
You are training a linear regression model on a representative sample in order to predict house prices. 
Performance tests suggest that the model has an issue of high estimator bias in combination with low estimator variance. 
What action below is likely to solve the high bias issue?
A)
Collect more labeled data.
B)
Add higher-order polynomial terms.
C)
Increase the weights on regularization terms.
D)
Use a subsample of the da





2.You performed a linear fit on a dataset with two variables, x1 and x2 . 
The p-value for x1 is 0.01 and that for x2 is 0.1. Which statement is false?

A)
p-value is the probability to find the observed or more extreme value for the test statistic given that 
the null hypothesis is false.
B)
p-value is the probability to find the observed or more extreme value for the test statistic given that 
the null hypothesis is true.
C)
Variable x2 could have no effect at all on the response variable.
D)
The fitting coefficient of variable x1 is generally considered statistically significant.





3.
Which metric is not used for evaluating the performance of a regression model?

A)
F1-score
B)
AIC
C)
R-squared value
D)
RMSE


4.
In the US, the number of new cases of cancer is 454.8 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 cases, 
National CancerInstitute). You have built a model to support the detection of cancer cases. The model accuracy amounts to 99.55%, however it was unable to correctly detect a single case of cancer. Which of the following statements is true?
A)
False negative rate of the model is 0.45%.
B)
Error rate of the model is 0.05%.
C)
Recall of the model is 0.45%.
D)
Specificity of the model is 100%.


TP  FP 
FN  TN

TP/TP+FN
FP/FP+TN


TP+Tn/All =99%



5.K-fold cross-validation means to split data into k subsets, and train models on k-1 subsets while leaving one set out for evaluation. In which of the following situations is cross validation generally unnecessary?

A)
Optimizing the depth of a decision tree for a random forest model.
B)
Reducing the dimensionality of data using PCA.
C)
Choosing the number of clusters for a k-means model.[Typo , it should mean kk FOld then righta nswer is B ]
D)
Determining weights for the regularization terms of ridge regression.




6. An online social media platform has asked you to develop a churn propensity model. You have built a boosted tree model with 500 trees and
maximum depth of 50. The AUC value is 0.95 on training data, but only 0.5 on test data. To improve model performance on test data, which step
would you recommend to try next?
A)
Reduce maximum tree depth.
B)
Increase number of trees.
C)
Reduce from 10-fold cross validation to 3-fold.
D)
Apply a logarithmic transformation to features that are not normally distributed.



7.
You are working on a binary classification model, but the data set is imbalanced. I.e., the positive class is much smaller than the negative class.
Which of the following methods is NOT used to tackle this problem?

A)SMOTE
B)Using class weights
C)Undersampling the majority class
D)L2 regularization






8.Which of the following loss functions is most sensitive to outlying data points?
A)
Mean Absolute Loss
B)
Huber Loss
C)
Mean squared loss
D)
Quantile loss





9.What is NOT one of the advantages of dimensionality reduction?
A)
It reduces the computational power needed to train a model
B)
It decreases the chance that the model will overfit the data
C)
It becomes easier to visualize highly dimensional data
D)
It increases the amount of information available to the model





10.We are playing a game of Russian Roulette. I put 3 bullets in a gun with six chambers, and I put the bullets all next to each other. I close the cylinder, I
spin it, and I present you with two strategies:
1. You fire the gun three times without spinning the cylinder in between
2. You fire the gun three times, each time spinning the cylinder in between
I flip an unbiased coin: if it is heads, you must follow strategy 1; if it is tails, you must follow strategy 2. What are your odds of survival?


A)
7/48
B)
5/16
C)
1/9
D)
5/19
