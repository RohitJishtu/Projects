# You are given a list find the Kth Lowest element in the list , without sorting 
# Given two strings s1 and s2, find the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS). If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
# The strings are composed of lower case English alphabets.
# A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived by deleting some or no characters such that the order of the remaining characters remain the same.

# Example
# s1: "workattech"
# s2: "branch"
# Result: 4
# Explanation: Longest common subsequence is "rach"


# s1="helloworld"
# s2="playword"
# s1="hello"
# s2="hello"
# s1="abc"
# s2="def"




# LOGIC : 
# Make dictionary of second word 
# b:0 , r:1 , a:2 , n:3 , c:4 , h:5 

# if w in dict:
#     posiytion = w(post)
#     SubSeq=1 
#     go to next positiononwatds only 


s1="baa"
s2="caab"
Result =4 

def LongestSubSeq(s1,s2):
