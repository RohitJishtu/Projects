# Write a function: that, given an array
# `integers
# `
# consisting of N integers, returns the maximum among all one-digit integers. For example, given array
# `integers
# `
# as
# follows:
# [-6,-91, 1011,-100, 84,-22, 0, 1, 473]
# the function should return 1.
# Assume that:
# - N is an integer within the range [1..1,000];
# - each element of array
# `integers
# ` is an integer within the range [âˆ’10,000..10,000];
# - there is at least one element in the array which satisfies the condition in the task statement.
# In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
